# Zillow Property Value Predictions

## 1. Introduction

In the rapidly evolving real estate market, accurate property valuation holds immense importance for homeowners and property investors alike. This project is dedicated to developing a predictive model for property values of Single Family Properties that underwent transactions during the year 2017. This project holds significant importance as it directly addresses the critical need to provide accurate property values. By predicting properety values, we aim to empower our users with valuable insights, aiding in informed decision-making and enhancing their overall experience on the Zillow platform.
